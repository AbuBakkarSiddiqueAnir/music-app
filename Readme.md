# music app

## Solution Architecture:

The web app will be developed using ReactJS and TypeScript.

The UI will be designed using Bootstrap (v5.0) and React Bootstrap components.

The app will use Keycloak for authentication and authorization.

The app will use Stripe for payment processing.

The app will use an API (such as the Shazam API) to search for music.

Redux will be used for state management.

The app will be containerized using Docker.

## Steps to Implement:

1. Set up a new ReactJS project using TypeScript.
   - Use a tool like `create-react-app` to create a new ReactJS project with TypeScript support.

2. Install the required dependencies such as React Bootstrap, Keycloak, Stripe, Redux, and Docker.
   - Use `npm` or `yarn` to install the required dependencies.

3. Create a UI with a sidebar containing Home, Search, Favourites, and Playlists.
   - Use React Bootstrap components to create the UI and the sidebar.

4. Implement authentication and authorization using Keycloak. Create two different roles, normal user, and Pro user.
   - Use the Keycloak documentation to set up authentication and authorization for your app. Create two different roles, normal user and Pro user, and restrict access to certain sections of the app based on the user's role.

5. Implement the Stripe payment gateway and allow the user to buy a Pro license.
   - Use the Stripe documentation to set up the payment gateway for your app. Create a Pro license that users can buy to gain access to the Pro features of the app.

6. Integrate an API to search for music and display the results in the Search section.
   - Use an API like the Shazam API to search for music and display the results in the Search section of your app.

7. Implement a favourites section where users can add music to their favourite list.
   - Create a favourites section where users can add music to their favourite list and display the list of favourite music.

   - Create a playlists section where users can create new playlists, add music to the playlists, and view their existing playlists. This section will only be available to Pro users who have bought the Pro license.

9. Use Redux to manage the application's state, such as user authentication status, user preferences, and music playlists.
   - Use Redux to manage the application's state, such as user authentication status, user preferences, and music playlists.

10. Containerize the application using Docker and deploy it to a cloud platform like AWS or Google Cloud.
   - Use Docker to containerize the application and deploy it to a cloud platform like AWS or Google Cloud.

## Bonus Features:

11. Use local storage to retain user preferences even after the browser is closed.
   - Use the local storage to retain user preferences even after the browser is closed. This will provide a better user experience for returning users.

12. Implement hover effects on individual items to enhance the UI.
